# My First Piece
To be honest, I never thought I'd be doing this, but I read [this](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), and I thought I'd try it out.  
I swear this isn't just for the recruiters ðŸ¤«  
If all goes well, maybe I'll end up selling courses, or I'll have a newsletter (and then I wake up)

## Q&A

**Who are you?**
- The perfect candidate for your company

**What am I going to write about?**
