So you want to learn vim?
The first and most important step before you learn vim is to reconsider it.  
If you still want to learn it, I'll give you the ultimate guide as someone that has been using it since about 7 (months ago) 
## Understanding the basics
- h = 1 char left
- j = 1 char down 
- k = 1 char up
- l = 1 char right
- h, j, k, l is so random why do we use them? 
    - It started because old keyboards had arrows keys on h, j, k, l...
- Once you master moving around like that you're ready
